// By Default If you didnt declare var it will take global variable as var

var home = "ROOM";
home = "ROOM";

// Both are Same

// By default it takes variable as global variable as var

// Ruling for Naming Variables
// 1. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
// 2. Variable names are case sensitive.
// 3. Variable names should not be JavaScript keywords.
// Keywords are var , let , const
// 4. Variable names should not start with a number.
// 5. Use meaningful names in variables
// 6. Use CamelCase for naming variables
